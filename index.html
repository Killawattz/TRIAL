									<p>This website displays statistics in a visual mapping formation, displaying categorized data compiled to demonstrate the distribution of certain method of transport categories. Whether that be via car, train, bicycle etc. This data is collected through the Australian Bureau of Statistics from the last census  which took place in 2016. This is processed in the form of Mesh Blocks, and Mesh Blocks are the smallest geographical segments of area generated by the ABS, designed as geographical building blocks for data. This websites aim is present a basic piece of data journalism, data journalism is using the aid of technology to present data in a much more engaging manner, using the data to tell a story, rather than just some number on a page. This can be done through infographics, programming techniques, colourful and interactable maps that visually display data and convey a much greater understanding, which is done through this website.</p>

									<p>The dataset displayed used within this website, was collected from the ABS website, and is Method of Travel to Work by Sex, and the data was collected via all employed persons aged 15 years and over. This data can be used by someone to determine the spread of individuals using each method of travel, it can be used to determine why the private vehicle population on the road is so high, and can be used to improve public transport facilities within the city.</p>

									<h2 class="major">The Latte Line</h2>
									<p>The latte line is a line that divides the  two sections of Sydney, a line that diagonally intersects Sydney that basically separates the Northern and Eastern Suburb, from the Western and Southern suburbs, and this in general terms is the ‘separation of the rich and poor’. This divide becomes obvious with the visual mapping within this website, displayed on the maps.</p>

									<p> The heaviest users of car travel lie within the areas further from the city, as the patches of land start to become lighter in colour and increase in proportion. Regions closer to the city mostly don't using car travel, along with people living in close proximity to train stations, which becomes clear upon close inspection.

									<p>This graph presents a more interesting layout deomstrating a higher separation of individual user groups as it vaguely displays the proportion of those that live in close promximity but not directly on the train line. It actaully separtes the people that wotk within the Sydney region from the people that don't highlighting various suburbs around sydney that don't have easy access to a train line and therfore drive to the station. Suburbs such as Liverpool, Campbelltown, Penrith, Hornsby, etc. </p>

									<p>This graph presents another interesting layout but presents similar results in a more skewed manner in comparison to the other findings. Most people partake in this method live within fairly close proximity to central sydney area, again following that train line network slightly. It demonstrates that most people within these areas completely rely on public transport which makes sense as public transport facilities within these areas are quite sufficient.</p>

								<div class="intro color0">
									<h2 class="major">Income</h2>
									<p>This is a map of the highest income earners within the data set, which are people earning over 4000 a week. Within first glance, the map clearly paints the evidence of the latte line, where the blue reprsents the greatest proportion of this population demographic. If you were to assume rich people would drive to work simply beacause they can afford it, you'd be wrong. When comparing this to the car map, a lower proportion of people drive to work over the less rich people out west according to statistics. </p>

							<section class="panel">
								<div class="intro color0">
									<h2 class="major">Vehicle Per Household</h2>
									<p><strong> Top Section: 2 Vehicles Bottom Left: 0 Vehicles Bottom Right: 0 Vehicles. </strong> Again this data presents interesting information, demonstrating that a higher proportion of people within the Northern section own 2 cars, even though the previous data displays that a lower proportion of people in the Northern sector actually drive to work. This allows us to deduce that people above the latte line don't use their car for work travel, and people below use their car to travel to work. </p>

									<p>This data can be interpreted a number of ways, and a  number of answers can be deduced through analysis, such as the significance of the latte line. The maps provide insightful data that detail answers that were expected and some not so expected, and when comparing datasets that statement rains very true. </p>
